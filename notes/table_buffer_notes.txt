Notes on table and buffer io

API to support

(table-ref table-name index)
(table-set! table-name index value)
(table->vector table-name)
(table-ref-vector table-name vector {index} {count})
(table-set-vector! table-name vector {index} {count})
(vector->table ?? ) ? make a new max table? do we want this??

- table-set-vector! tabs
  table-set! table vector 
- table-set! table-name index value



- working now, but if we send floats, they get converted to 0s, which is probably not what we want??
  - not sure if it's better to have it slow down table update to change the value or not.. hmm



DONE:
- table-ref and table-set! now working with proper error messages
NEXT:
- create vector from table 
- 
tabv
tabsv
vector->table -> make a named table in Max? not sure if we want to do that

left off working on table->vector
