Plan for version 0.2
- table i/o
- buffer i/o
- scheduling with ms
- scheduling with clock

Status:
- table tests working (in patchers/table-io-tests-1.maxpat)
- doing it now for buffers


V0.2 need to do:
- add the global control for turning off logging
- add the table tests to the regression suite

table-io-tests-1 is not working right (not all passing)

buffer tests has an error
- buffer test comparisons aren't working right
