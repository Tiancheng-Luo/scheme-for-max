Points for the docs around schedule:

- it you reset a transports time, transports can get out of sync with the master clock
- my quantize will stay with the master clock

TODO:
- reset needs to clear out the clock listeners properly

IN REGRESSION SUITE
- transport tests
- delay tests


TODO:
- tests for listen functions 
- write up delay docs

- listen test:
  
(listen 100 (lambda (ticks) ticks))

Testing listen-ticks
- I think I don't have clean up of clocks and ticks working right yet
  - closing a patcher that has registered listeners seems to crash the next
  time the transport is activated
