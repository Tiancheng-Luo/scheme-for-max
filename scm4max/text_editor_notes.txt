Getting the text editor to work:

- double click opens, 
- we need to open the file specified if there is a file there

- saving and eval'ing working
- loading up initial content from file 

- file does get saved, but we want the filename that is the first arg to be loaded

- where is the source filename stored already?
  scm4max_doread(x, x->source_file);
- in doread we load the file via s7_load,
  but we in this case we need to load the text into the editor buffer

- trying out:
  - read source filecontents into memory of object for now 
- oops, this can't share the doread method, because that handles the "read foobar.scm" message
  which should *not* be updating the editor buffer.

- load a filename in the box: works
  - file loads ok
  - filename gets saved (is _sym_nothing if not present)
- reload on changed file: 
  - works, and wipes object (desired behaviour)
- double-clicking on the editor:
  - opens editor and fills contents
- closing editor without save should do nothing
  - working
- closing editor with a save should:
  - alter the file on disk - working
  - reload the file into S7, working, but not posting (oddly)
  - TODO: reload the contents of the saved file into the working buffer
    - is not filing a re-read

- got it working, but note, it does not handle deferring properly yet
  - still need to do that with the whole build a list of atoms etc
- also worth checking if it behaves like the JS object  
- check on whether the freeing is correct
  - do that today!

- LEFTOFF: make sure cleanup of those handles is working ok
