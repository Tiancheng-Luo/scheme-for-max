# scheme-for-max
Scheme-for-max is a Max/MSP external to allow scripting max with S7 Scheme / Lisp.

This is my project directory for figuring out scheme scripting for max. At present it should be considered experimental only. Go ahead and use it if it's useful, but it is subject to change without notice and could be broken at any time!

There will be documentation, tutorials, and video examples coming over the next several months (2020-01-29). In the meantime, if this piques your interest and you want to hear about progress, you can join the scheme-for-max google group. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scheme-for-max

We are using S7 Scheme, a "lisp-y" Scheme by Bill Schottstaedt at CCRMA, based originally on Tiny Scheme. S7 is a an easy to embed scheme intrepreter, with many nice features for algorithmic composition and embeddding, such as first-class environments, thread safety, applicative syntax, keywords, a very straight forward FFI (foreign function interface), and Common Lisp style-macros. 

License: As S7 Scheme, and TinyScheme on which it is based, are BSD licensed, this is too.
