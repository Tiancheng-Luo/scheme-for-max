# scheme-for-max
Max/MSP external to allow scripting max with scheme, uses S7 scheme

This is my project directory for figuring out scheme scripting for max. At present
(2020-01-07) it should be considered experimental only. Go ahead and use it if it's
useful, but it is subject to change without notice and could be broken at any time!
(When it is more functional, I will switch to a clean master with dev branches)

License: As S7 Scheme, and TinyScheme on which it is based, are BSD licensed, this is too.
